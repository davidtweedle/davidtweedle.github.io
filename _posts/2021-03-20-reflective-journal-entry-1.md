I used a critical incident questionnaire as described in Brookfield Chapter 6.
In total, 3 students responded out of 5 students who attended the zoom class live.
It was a Microsoft forms questionnaire and I sent the link in the last ten minutes of class and I ended class 10 minutes early.
In the next week's class, I responded to the questionnaires.

I got some very helpful responses even though there were not very many in total.

### The good ###
The following was helpful to the students
- a question asked by a fellow student
- a certain topic was presented in a motivating way
- the recordings being available for classes
- the assignments are clear in terms of what is expected
- something I said helped to clarify a topic from weeks ago

### The bad ###
The following could be improved upon
- more questions/examples should be done in class
- a certain topic was presented in a confusing way
- quoting a students response:
> Everything is always confusing in the beginning these days. Learning through online school during a pandemic is really hard.

### Reflection ###
The critical incident questionnaire made me realize that I must organize things so that the students can work through more examples as we learn.
I must remember that everyone is having a tough time (me and my students) and I really must cut them some slack.
I would like to find a way to encourage more students to participate in class, but at the same time, I do not want to force participation.

Based on these points, I want to make sure to keep empathy for my students. This can be hard sometimes, but I will make sure to think of the students.
I will also prioritize examples/problems in my live teaching sessions over zoom.
If I must present less interactive content, I will do so by asynchronous youtube videos.
I will keep using critical incident questionnaires, and taking time to reflect on the results weekly.
