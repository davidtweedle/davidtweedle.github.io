### Introduction
In our groups, we were to conduct a peer observation among ourselves.
- My group members were K,S,A and myself
- Our observations were structured as K to S to D to A to K
- We were to conduct pre-observation meetings, and post-observation meetings, then reflect on the findings.
- we all observed recordings of classes, due to the pandemic and scheduling issues
- then, as a group, we wrote up our findings and presented them to the class
- This document is my personal reflection on the whole process (fleshed out from my own notes, with the benefit of the wisdom gained from the rest of the group)
### Critical and structured analysis of the PO process
- Did we truly consider changing the questions on the different forms? (I didn't)
- I should have interrogated the purpose of the forms and the peer observation
- for example, what did I want, what did the person who I was observing want
- the forms were crucial to the process of evaluating the teaching session, and to the reflection process
- more time would have helped
### Well treated account of impact of the entire process
- For me the impact was that the person who observed my teaching session gave me concrete things to work on, and the impact of my observation was that I was inspired to try to interact with the class more, and be more enthusiastic
### Sustaining a professional community of learners
- this part of the course would be a wonderful workshop
- OR can be introduced at a faculty/dept level
- the discussion and adjucation that I received was very beneficial to me, and I hope it was for my groupmates as well
### Fresh perspective on insight presented
- try to be upbeat and in tune with the students
- going to use a ``pen tablet'' to give a better experience for the students
- consider mixing examples on the board with powerpoint
### Guidance and support to colleagues
- reduce amount of text on slides
- give an outline of the goals/learning outcomes/etc for the day
- colleague was an enthusiastic teacher - keep it up
- colleague modelled student/teacher interactions with co-teacher - great work
- colleague used a variety of media to give the students a break - very empathetic
### Means of improvement
- check in with students more often
- keep up the pace of teaching
- upgrade delivery method
- keep doing examples
- elicit feedback from students more often
### Pre-recorded sessions versus live visits
- live visits would not have been possible
- pre-recorded sessions were more convenient
- pre-recorded sessions did not make it possible to see the feelings and reactions of the students
- the pre-recorded sessions were more natural than a live visit would have been - when someone visits the class the teacher can't help but teach differently
