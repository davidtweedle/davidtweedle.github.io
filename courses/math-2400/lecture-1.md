In this video we cover the following concepts:

*Divides* - We say $$ d $$ divides $$ n $$ if there exists an integer $$ k $$ such that $$ n = d\cdot k $$. We write $$ d \mid n $$.

*Well-ordering principle* - Let $$ S \subseteq \mathbb{N} $$ and assume $$ S \neq \emptyset $$.
Then $$ S $$ has a least element.

*Division algorithm* - Let $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ be integers with $$ a\neq 0 $$.
Then there exists unique integers $$ q $$ and $$ r $$ such that 
1. $$ b = qa + r $$,
2. $$ 0\leq r < \lvert a \rvert $$.

*Prime* - a number $$ n\geq 2 $$ is prime if its only positive divisors are $$ 1 $$ and $$ n $$. Otherwise, $$ n $$ is called composite.

*Products of primes* - every integer $$ n\geq 2 $$ can be written as a product of primes.
