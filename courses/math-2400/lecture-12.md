This series of videos is about periodic continued fractions.
Before watching the videos, remember the following facts and definitions.

**Definition** - nearly simple continued fraction
**Definition** - $$n$$-th convergents
**Proposition** - formula for nearly simple continued fraction

In this first video, we will prove the following lemma.

**Lemma** - If $$[a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n,z] = \frac{A+Bz}{C+Dz}$$ then $$\frac{1}{[a_n,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_0,\frac{1}{w}]} = \frac{A+Cw}{B+Dw}$$.

Now using the lemma above, we are able to establish that if $$a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n$$ are positive integers such that

$$ \alpha = [\overline{a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n}] $$

and

$$ \beta = [\overline{a_n,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_0] $$

then $$\alpha $$ is the root of a quadratic polynomial and the conjugate root $$\alpha'$$ satisfies $$\alpha' = \frac{-1}{\beta}$$, so that $$-1<\alpha'<0$$.

The following video illustrates the process.

In fact, there is a converse to the above result.

**Theorem (Converse to above).** Suppose that $$\alpha>1$$ is the root of a quadratic polynomial $$Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$$ whose conjugate root $$\alpha'$$ is such that $$-1<\alpha'<0$$.
Then the continued fraction of $$\alpha$$ is purely periodic.

One of the ingredients in the proof of the converse is to prove that for fixed $$D>0$$ there are only finitely many $$P,Q$$ such that $$\frac{P+\sqrt{D}}{Q}>1$$ and $$-1 <\frac{P-\sqrt{D}}{Q}<0$$.

This is discussed briefly in the following video.

Finally, we discuss the continued fraction expansion of $$\sqrt{N}$$ in the below video.
