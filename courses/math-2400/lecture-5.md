This video is about equations of the form $$ a X + b Y = c $$ where $$ a,b,c\in \mathbb{Z} $$ and $$ X,Y$$ are variables. We aim to find all integer solutions $$ x, y $$.

Problems:

1. Suppose $$ d = \gcd(a,b) $$ and $$ d\nmid c $$. Prove that $$ aX + bY = c $$ has no integer solutions $$ X,Y $$.

2. If $$ d \mid c $$ prove that a solution to $$ax + by = c $$ exists.

3. Solve $$ 15 x + 20 y = 100 $$

4. Solve $$ 15x - 2y = 1 $$

5. Find all positive solutions to the above equations.
