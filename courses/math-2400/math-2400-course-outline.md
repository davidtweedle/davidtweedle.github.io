### What is elementary number theory ###
In this class, we go through a buffet of results in elementary number theory.
Some highlights are:
- modular arithmetic
- quadratic reciprocity
- primitive roots
- public key cryptography

### What can you expect from this course ###
- develop appreciation for classical number theory
- work on your proof writing skills
- learn about the connection between number theory and modern technologies

### What I expect from you ###
- skim notes before watching the videos
- watch videos, and do the exercises at the end
- if anything is not making sense, ask in class, or by e-mail

### How to study ###
- review definitions
- do practice problems
- invent your own problems
- review proofs of theorems (do they make sense?)
- summarize proofs of theorems

### Assessment information ###
Tentatively (this may change based on feedback from AQAC)
- 50% final exam
- 20% first coursework exam
- 20% second coursework exam
- 10% assignments (5 assignments, drop the lowest marks)
