### Problems ###
1. Define standard vector addition, and scalar multiplication for $$ \mathbb{R}^3$$. Write down the zero vector and $$ -\mathbf{x} $$ where $$ \mathbf{x} = \left(\begin{array}{c}x\\y\\z\end{array}\right) $$.
2. Prove that $$ \alpha\cdot \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0} $$ and $$ 0\cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} $$.
3. Let $$ V = F[x] $$ and let $$ W = \{ f\in V\ \mid\ f(-x) = f(x)\} $$ be the subset of even polynomials with coefficients in $$ F $$. Prove that $$ W $$ is a subspace of $$ V $$. If $$ F = \mathbb{R} $$ prove that $$ W = \mathrm{span}(1, x^2, x^4,\ldots, x^{2n},\ldots) $$.
4. There is an error in the following example from the video: $$ W = \{ A\in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n} \ \mid \ A^* = A\} $$. What is the error?
5. Let $$ X = \{0,1,2,3,4\} $$ and $$ V_1 = \mathbb{R}^X $$ and $$V_2 = \mathbb{R}^5 $$. Can you find a correspondence between $$ V_1 $$ and $$ V_2 $$?
