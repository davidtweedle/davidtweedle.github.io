This video describes the relationship between a direct sum decomposition and the coordinates of a vector.

**Direct sum** - In this video, we have the direct sum decomposition

$$ V = V_1 \oplus V_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus V_n $$

where $$ V_1 $$, $$ V_2 $$, ..., $$ V_n $$ are subspaces of $$ V $$.
This means that each $$ \mathbf{v}\in V $$ can be expressed uniquely as 

$$ \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_1 + \cdots + \mathbf{v}_n $$

where $$ \mathbf{v}_1\in V_1 $$, $$\mathbf{v}_2\in V_2 $$, ..., $$\mathbf{v}_n\in V_n $$.

Each subspace has its own basis, $$ B_i = \mathbf{v}_{r_1 + \cdots + r_{i-1} + 1},\ldots \mathbf{v}_{r_1 + \cdots + r_i} $$.
In other words, $$ V_i $$ has dimension $$ r_i $$ and so the dimension of $$ V $$ is $$r_1 + \cdots + r_n $$.

In the video we see how the coordinates of a vector $$\mathbf{v}\in V$$ decomposes in terms of the direct sum decomposition.
