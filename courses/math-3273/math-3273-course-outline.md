### What is linear algebra 2 ###
One way to think about linear algebra is the study of linear transformations $$ T:V \to V$$ where $$V$$ is a vector space.
Another way to think about it is the study of $$n$$ by $$n$$ matrices, and all their associated data (rowspace, columnspace, nullspace, left-nullspace, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, etc.)
In this course, we will try to take a mixed approach, sometimes studying linear algebra from an abstract perspective and sometimes from a concrete matrix perspective.
Here are some of the topics you will see in this course:
- Cayley-Hamilton theorem
- Canonical forms
- Inner product spaces and the spectral theorem
- Singular value decomposition

### What can you expect from this course ###
- develop appreciation for the power of abstract thinking
- work on your proof writing skills
- work on your problem solving skills
- apply linear algebra to solve problems

### What I expect from you ###
- skim notes before watching the videos
- watch videos, and do the exercises at the end
- if anything is not making sense, ask in class, or by e-mail

### How to study ###
- review definitions
- do practice problems
- invent your own problems
- review proofs of theorems (do they make sense?)
- summarize proofs of theorems

### Assessment information ###
Tentatively (this may change based on feedback from AQAC)
- 50% final exam
- 20% first coursework exam
- 20% second coursework exam
- 10% assignments (5 assignments, drop the lowest mark)
