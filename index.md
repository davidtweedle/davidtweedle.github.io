I am a lecturer in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.sta.uwi.edu/fst/dms) in the [Faculty of Science and Technology](https://www.sta.uwi.edu/fst/) at the [University of the West Indies, St. Augustine](https://www.sta.uwi.edu).

Mostly, I teach abstract algebra and linear algebra, but sometimes I teach other things.
My research area is number theory.
More specifically, I like to think about Artin's primitive root conjecture and related topics as well as number theory of function fields.

## More information
I used the jekyll theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima#readme) as a base for this website (with very minor modifications).
The pages are mostly done in markdown.
This website is hosted on github.
