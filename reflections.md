## Journal entry 1 - CUTL 5207 ##
>
> In one of your classes, use a strategy/method to gauge student perceptions of the class as suggested by Stephen Brookfield in the reading *Seeing Ourselves through Student's Eyes* (Chapter 6) **or any other of your choice e.g. student evaluation.**
>
> Reflect on
>
> 1. What the students thought was good.
> 2. What they thought could be improved.
> 3. How do you plan to address any areas for improvement or improve the class in any way
>
> Aim for a reflection of no more than 500 words
>
> Submit your reflection by uploading as a word document here.

I used a critical incident questionnaire as described in Brookfield Chapter 6.
In total, 3 students responded out of 5 students who attended the zoom class live.
It was a Microsoft forms questionnaire and I sent the link in the last ten minutes of class and I ended class 10 minutes early.
In the next week's class, I responded to the questionnaires.

I got some very helpful responses even though there were not very many in total.

### The good ###
The following was helpful to the students
- a question asked by a fellow student
- a certain topic was presented in a motivating way
- the recordings being available for classes
- the assignments are clear in terms of what is expected
- something I said helped to clarify a topic from weeks ago

### The bad ###
The following could be improved upon
- more questions/examples should be done in class
- a certain topic was presented in a confusing way
- quoting a students response:
> Everything is always confusing in the beginning these days. Learning through online school during a pandemic is really hard.

### Reflection ###
The critical incident questionnaire made me realize that I must organize things so that the students can work through more examples as we learn.
I must remember that everyone is having a tough time (me and my students) and I really must cut them some slack.
I would like to find a way to encourage more students to participate in class, but at the same time, I do not want to force participation.

Based on these points, I want to make sure to keep empathy for my students. This can be hard sometimes, but I will make sure to think of the students.
I will also prioritize examples/problems in my live teaching sessions over zoom.
If I must present less interactive content, I will do so by asynchronous youtube videos.
I will keep using critical incident questionnaires, and taking time to reflect on the results weekly.

## Journal entry 2 - Thoughts on the role of technology (CUTL 5106) ##

### Introduction ###
This is a journal post for CUTL 5106 in response to the following prompt:
> Reflect on your use of technology as a teacher and share your views on the role technology can play in teaching and learning. As you reflect, consider the following:
>
> 1. What is YOUR definition of educational technology?
> 2. Why do you use the technologies you do?
> 3. Why do you choose not to use other technologies? What guides your choices?
> 
> Examine your personal [teaching philosophy](/teaching/#teaching-philosophy) you developed in Module 1 and state to what extent your philosophy includes the use of technology.

### Response ###

Educational technology is anything that helps me connect with the students.

In my teaching, I use myelearning to distribute the course outline, assignments, assignment solutions, extra notes, exam solutions, practice exams and to communicate with students (post announcements, ask for feedback). I use the whiteboard (and rarely slides) to communicate information to the students.  One thing that I don't use but that I should try to incorporate as the terms progress is languages such as MATLAB and Maple and Sage so that students can incorporate the theory of what we learn in class with the computational details.  I don't use any other online technologies, I guess I do not see the point to them.  My philosophy does not really mention technology, but as I improve perhaps that can change.

I use myelearning mostly so that I can save the time it takes to hand out physical copies of paper.  It also means that I can post extensively detailed solutions to assignments, as well as notes that some students may be interested in but that are tangential to the course.  Myelearning is also really useful as it is a direct line to the students if I want to say cancel Thursday's class due to some unforeseen event.  The main drawback of myelearning is accessibility.  That is, if a student is not registered on time then if my distribution handouts is via myelearning, this person may be completely lost.

I use the whiteboard because when I was taught the main tool was chalk and board (which I much prefer to whiteboard).  The act of writing on the board forces the students to slow down and think about what is said.  If the students want to diverge from the lesson plan, we can do that without too much trouble.  If the students want to do more examples, we can make up some and do them together on the board.

Technology can improve the efficiency of our interactions, but we should not let it get in our way.

### Facilitator Response ###
“Technology can improve the efficiency of our interactions but we should not let it get in our way”. This is a quote from your journal. One of your thoughtful comments to address the questions asked. I would have liked to see some more evidence of engagement with the literature. You could have added more value to this post by reflecting on an established definition/s and showing how these definitions resonate or do not resonate, with you and why. I also like that you look at a range of tools to enhance your teaching. it would have been good to indicate from the literature why this is important and also what strategy you can adopt in your own practice to be more mindful regarding the tools you use and do not use. I sense it is more about convenience at this point?

### Response ###
Thanks for your comments Prof. I tried to engage more with the readings on the second journal. For me the tools that I use are decided only by convenience. It is something that I hope to change, but I cannot do so until things settle down a little (whenever that happens).

## Journal entry 3 - Reflecting on integrating media (CUTL 5106) ##

### Introduction ###
In CUTL 5106, we were asked to respond to the following prompt:
> Identify some of the approaches you can take to more effectively select and integrate media in **YOUR** teaching.
>
> Justify your selection by drawing on your reading and class experiences.

### Response ###
One approach to integrate media in my teaching is to use the video lectures from online courses (MIT online course ware, for example).  I could identify an area that students need extra help in, or an area that is not central to the learning objectives but could be interesting or useful to a subset of students.  Then I could direct those students to a video (either in part or whole) from an online course that is available freely.  As suggested in the videoaktiv handbook, I could provide a handout to guide the students through the lecture and follow up with questions directed toward the video material. The students might appreciate the brand of the online course.

Another approach is to make an animation produced using maple (or other software).  This can really help jumpstart students imaginations.  It should be really effective in certain first year courses, to demonstrate concepts such as integration, volumes of rotation, conic sections, etc.  It seems like it should be very effective in some courses, but very limited in other courses.

Also, a screen cast to be used as an online tutorial to help students through difficult problems in assignments. My experience is that students like their hands to be held through new material sometimes. Therefore, a screen cast can help students who are too timid to come to office hours, and "don't know where to start"

### Facilitator response ###
Very practical suggestions David. I like the idea of using the branded online course which would also give your students exposure to and an opportunity to interact with students from outside The UWI if they so desire and experience another kind of environment. I am interested in seeing whether you actually incorporate this in your blended course when the time comes.

## Journal entry 4 - Conceptions of learning, teaching and reflective practice (CUTL 5001) ###

### Introduction ###
The following is a reflection on conceptions of learning, teaching and reflective practice for CUTL 5001.

### My journal entry ###
The warm-up involved using a tablet app to record what we think of learning and then recording the most commonly seen phrases.  There was some confusion from the late-comers. The warm-up exercise made me think about the question "what is learning and how does it occur?"  My answer was that learning is when we internalize others information.  For me, this perfectly describes what I love about learning and how I experience it.  Learning occurs by exposure and then more exposure and application.  My favourite professor in university explained to us how to give a talk: "Tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em, tell 'em, then tell 'em what you told 'em."  That is advice for how to give a talk, not for teaching, but that phrase reminds me to explain things more than once.  This experience made me think about how I want my students to learn and how I like to learn.  

We learned about six perspectives on learning ranging from the idea that learning is an increase of facts (low-level) to the idea that to learn is to change (high-level) and everything in between. In the hierarchy on the handout, I would say that my view of learning is from 4-5.  I would say that learning has also changed me but it is such a gradual process I usually do not even think of it that way.  When we chose the most common phrases, we tended to rate them 4-5.  One important point that I took away from this part is that "understanding" is not well-defined.  This is important information for me because understanding is important to me, but my idea of understanding a subject might be completely different than a students idea of understanding.

We proceeded to talk about two questions, "Does what I think about X affect how I approach X?" where X can be either learning or teaching. This connects to the course material on myelearning, especially the video on differences in motivation. That is, if a student thinks "I am bad at linear algebra" (the class I am teaching this term) then that affects how they approach the course, for example, they might have the attitude of "why try, I cannot pass anyway". This seems really applicable to my practise as often people approach math with such an attitude.  I often hear "I am bad at math" or "math is hard".  It is even possible for students in the math major to exhibit such an attitude, but replace math with geometry, for example. I feel like this attitude is hard to combat, but it can be overcome.  Unfortunately, when I have success in this area it is usually due to the student as much as me.  This is unfortunate because sometimes this attitude prevents students from trying in the first place. Sometimes I wonder if it is my place to be the endlessly encouraging teacher no matter what, or if such an approach is destructive and prevents the students from engaging on their own. I think I have some internal conflicts on these issues that I cannot seem to resolve.

We learned about behaviorism, cognitivism and constructivism.  In our small group, each of us presented our different area.  I did not really get the chance to fully discuss the topics. Our group discussed that each learning theory has its place in teaching. I was not really sure how to apply this to my own experience. I read a little bit about constructivism in teaching mathematics. It scares me a lot. This is for two reasons.  One reason is that I have only had two experiences in learning mathematics.  The first is the traditional lecture and individual assignment model. My second experience in learning mathematics is to read papers and books, and do exercises on my own. The other reason that it scares me is that it is completely different from how I am used to teaching. Eventually I hope to incorporate these ideas into my teaching but will there be a time when I am not so overwhelmed.

I read and watched the materials on myelearning.  I should be cognizant of the students workload.  This is a tough area for me because it is hard to tell when something is too easy or too hard.  In my teaching right now, I think my first assignment is too long.  But a hard first assignment will pay off later, but I'm not sure if the students realize this.  On the other hand, if they are discouraged from a first hard assignment, it will not pay off because the student will give up.  Assessment should be encouraging of the deep learning approach.  This seems to be in opposition to the previous point though.  In linear algebra, you must learn the basics before you can develop an intuition for what is going on.  I will try to include questions which encourage a student to really think in the coming assessments.  Perhaps I will ask the students to tackle the more basic problems as exercises for the reader.

In a course, I usually spend some time briefly going over things that I expect them to know.  For those who don't know, I try to explain the best I can.  In the paper about knowing your students, the author says that you must be cognizant of generational differences and cultural differences and so on.  I cannot really imagine using twitter although one of my colleagues who I respect does use it.

I plan to demonstrate my enthusiasm for the subject I am teaching more.  In fact, I am very enthusiastic about linear algebra itself.  But I tend to be a little bit reserved.  I can also try to motivate the material more. I feel like some of the motivation has to come before this course.  This is a second course in linear algebra but it feels like I am teaching first timers. Somehow I have to convince the students that they must engage with the material on their own, I just provide a guide to any interesting or misleading examples through assignments and notes.

### Facilitator response ###
Thanks for sharing this. I appreciate your insight. I invite you to think about (unpacking) what specifically  about the constructivist approach to teaching Maths will actually scare you and why.  What about the difference in teaching  makes you uncomfortable?  The student's possible reaction? Your ability to plan it? The time it takes? The dynamics of the class? etc... That's insightful in itself as you consider how you approach the design of your course, your own experiences, your preferences and how all of that jives with your learners' needs. 

Do you have any thoughts what motivates them and how the learner analysis will play into this? What about the role of andragogy?

I think you are doing a brilliant job of doing some preliminary thinking about this, I would like you to more explicitly bring in the readings and resources into your reflective writing to assist in grounding (or expanding) your thoughts a bit more. 

### My response
> What about the difference in teaching makes you uncomfortable? The student's possible reaction? Your ability to plan it? The time it takes? The dynamics of the class? etc..

I think it makes me uncomfortable in several ways. One way is that I have been through the lecture experience many many times (both good and bad lectures). So I have a baseline when I am teaching this way. I can say to myself, that lecture was not as good as the better classes I've attended, maybe I can improve by doing x,y,z or maybe I should make sure to prepare more next time. Or maybe the lecture goes well, that is good too. On the other hand, I have little experience with being in a class that is not taught the way I am used to.
Another way it makes me uncomfortable is simply that I do not feel so comfortable working in groups. I do not mean research, which involves close work with one or two people who I know well. I mean the type of group work where everyone is asked to join a group of three. Therefore, it makes me uncomfortable to ask others to do this kind of thing.
You are also correct, though, the amount of work is scary. Well teaching is a lot of work, but changing the way you teach wholesale seems like a lot more work.

> Do you have any thoughts what motivates them and how the learner analysis will play into this?

I am not really sure about learner analysis. I tend to have a few different types of students every year. I just try to cater to each of them in some way. It is easy to cater to the students who want to be in class. I just try to show them that the class is exciting in its way. For the students who have many time commitments, I try to be very clear on what I want them to do. For the students who are forced to be there, I respect that they might only want to do the bare minimum, but if they choose to do more they will find that it is worthwhile.

> What about the role of andragogy?

Andragogy doesn't really make any sense to me. I try to treat my students as adults. Those students that respect the time and effort that I put in to the class usually respond with equal effort.

## Peer evaluation ##
The following is a peer observation report by a fellow CUTLer during CUTL 5207.

### Peer observation

>What went well with the session?

- Good engagement through Q&A with students at the beginning.
- Good organization, information presented in an easy to follow sequence - easy to follow

>Can you identify areas for reflection and possible improvement?

- Reconsider medium, i.e., use of a powerpoint or other, rather than the pen and paper tools - visibility is wavering in terms of both handwriting and clarity of image (some blurriness)
- Pacing is slow, with some extended pausing that disrupts flow and connectivity; sounds uncertain at points due to style of delivery
- Interactivity with class could have been enhanced throughout the session.
- What is the takeaway for assignment five? Explanation seems incomplete since you said, "I'm going to leave it there for today" suggesting there is more.
- Body not apparent, just hand and voice. Very laid back, which is not bad, but could have enhanced energy of delivery and enthusiasm.
- Would have been useful to prepare all this in advance using presentation tools and speak to it rather than write on the spot.
- Might have been useful to do a check in with students before the 6 minute break

>Do you have any comments on specific areas of focus identified prior to observation?

- You have achieved the aim you stated to explain clearly. However, some mini assessment tools could have been deployed throughout to double check how students are understanding.
- Students who learn from 'show and tell' would be comfortable, but those who need explanation to understand basis or reasons may not be fully following. So consideration for more types of learners might be useful

>What have you learnt that you can use in your own teaching?

- Seeing the lecturer doing an exercise can boost confidence so this may be something useful to apply to my own teaching strategies.

### Reflection
Now my own reflection on the peer observation.

> Critical and structured analysis of the PO process

- Did we consider changing the questions on the different forms? (I know I didn't).
- I think I should have asked more about what everyone was trying to get from the PO.
- On the other hand, I think using the form helped me to actively adjudicate the session I watched.
- Personally, I think more time would have helped.

> Well treated account of impact of entire process

- The impact was that the personw ho observed my class gave me concrete things to work on, and the impact of me watching was to get some new ideas and push me to do better.

> Rich discussion on building and sustaining a professional community

- If this section of the course could be offered as a workshop that could be taken every year, that would be amazing. This kind of discussion and similar parts of the other courses were very valuable to me.

> Fresh perspective on insight presented

- Try to be more upbeat and in tune.

> Means of improvement

- Check in with students
- Keep up pace

> Pre-recorded vs live visits

- Pre-recorded was more convenient.
- Pre-recorded sessions happened to be more true to life.
- Pre-recorded sessions did not allow us to see the body language and feeling of the class.
