### Work roles
- **Final exam randomization in Python** - I wrote a Python script which takes a set of bank of questions and randomizes them to produce final exams. This has become necessary due to examination conditions during the coronavirus pandemic.
- **uwiexam.cls file** - I updated a LaTeX class file originally written by Christoph Hamburger for the production of final exams for the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus. If you are interested, you can e-mail me for more information.
- **First examiner** - Currently, I am the first examiner for several courses.
- **Mathematical reviews** - I review articles for Mathematical reviews.
- **MSc supervisor** - I have supervised 2 MSc students.

### Research

I like to study objects such as the multiplicative group over a number field, the points of an elliptic curve over a number field, and Drinfeld modules (and other related objects).

Especially, I like to study analogues of Artin's conjecture for the above objects.
