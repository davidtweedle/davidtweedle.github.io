### Autobiography describing my path to teaching

I had many interesting and fruitful experiences as a learner in elementary school, high school, in music lessons and in university.
Then in grad school, I had the opportunity to be a tutor in the math help center, and to run a couple tutorial sessions. 
I found that this was a very rewarding experience.

My path to teaching, is that I want to repay all the great teachers in my life, who helped me learn and understand. But I can't repay them, so I will try my best to "pay it forward".
I know that I am not the most interesting teacher, but, year by year, I will improve.
My goal is not to be the most interesting teacher, but just to give back what I was given.

### Teaching Philosophy ###

Teaching mathematics to undergraduates can be a delicate process.  Coming from the CAPE exams, most students are not ready to take charge of their development.  On the other hand, hand-holding only prolongs this phase of immaturity where everything must be done for them.  I believe in letting the students discover for themselves the pitfalls of a topic and what heights they can achieve.  The student should feel like they are breaking new ground, while I work to make sure no one is left behind.  I must ensure that the students meet what is just beyond their current reach.  In my practice, I am a guide.  I present any material clearly and completely in a combination of typed notes and lectures.  The typed notes can give a more complete view of any relevant examples and helps to clear up any misconceptions.  I try very hard to make my assignments interesting and at the right level for the students.  If the assignments are too easy, the student doesn't get a chance to really engage with the material.  On the other hand, if the assignments are too difficult the students will get frustrated and give up.  I make sure that I am accessible during office hours and by e-mail.

For example, the start of the second year of studies can be very stressful for the students.  I often teach linear algebra to these students.  In this class, the students will be exposed to some abstract concepts and be expected to start working with the concepts right away.  This can be stressful.  A student came to me before the first assignment was due to clarify one question.  She told me that early on the assignment seemed very hard but after sitting down to do it, it wasn't so bad.  I hope that every student can surprise themselves in that way before the end of the course.

It is my job to let the students know what my expectations are.  Even the most motivated students can be discouraged by poorly worded or organized assessment.  I am very specific about what I expect on an assignment.  In turn, I expect to see the students write clear and organized solutions on an assignment or test.  I provide sample solutions to all assignments and exams which I expect the students to read.  Furthermore, I provide practice exam questions which I encourage the students to work on in exam conditions.

I believe that truly learning a topic takes a long time.  For example, in my own practice I have discovered subtleties and errors in my understanding in subjects I have taught several times before.  So it is my opinion that a learners job is never done.  The student must read or listen to the material (in lectures or online).  Then they must apply the material but only in a superficial way. At this point, a student must review the material again and, if it doesn't make sense, they have many resources to help them - friends in the class, my office hours, my e-mail, the help desk offered by the department, and supplemental notes online. Once these concepts start to solidify they can explore the nooks and crannies, and they can see how the different concepts interact.  It is my responsibility to provide an environment in which a student can flourish, by motivating the subject and each concept, by providing a range of exercises to engage the student, by providing supplemental notes for additional investigation and by making myself available through e-mail and office hours.  It is the students responsibility to take advantage of these tools and to take an interest in the course.

The classes that I look upon with fondness are those classes where all course materials really blended together.  The lectures were enthusiastic and clearly presented and any examples presented gave insight to the concepts.  Furthermore, the lectures informed the questions on the assignments, and vice verse. I work towards this ideal in the hopes that I can pass on my knowledge and enjoyment of math.
