### Teaching Philosophy ###

Teaching mathematics to undergraduates can be a delicate process.  Coming from the CAPE exams, most students are not ready to take charge of their development.  On the other hand, hand-holding only prolongs this phase of immaturity where everything must be done for them.  I believe in letting the students discover for themselves the pitfalls of a topic and what heights they can achieve.  The student should feel like they are breaking new ground, while I work to make sure no one is left behind.  I must ensure that the students meet what is just beyond their current reach.  In my practice, I am a guide.  I present any material clearly and completely in a combination of typed notes and lectures.  The typed notes can give a more complete view of any relevant examples and helps to clear up any misconceptions.  I try very hard to make my assignments interesting and at the right level for the students.  If the assignments are too easy, the student doesn't get a chance to really engage with the material.  On the other hand, if the assignments are too difficult the students will get frustrated and give up.  I make sure that I am accessible during office hours and by e-mail.

For example, the start of the second year of studies can be very stressful for the students.  I often teach linear algebra to these students.  In this class, the students will be exposed to some abstract concepts and be expected to start working with the concepts right away.  This can be stressful.  A student came to me before the first assignment was due to clarify one question.  She told me that early on the assignment seemed very hard but after sitting down to do it, it wasn't so bad.  I hope that every student can surprise themselves in that way before the end of the course.

It is my job to let the students know what my expectations are.  Even the most motivated students can be discouraged by poorly worded or organized assessment.  I am very specific about what I expect on an assignment.  In turn, I expect to see the students write clear and organized solutions on an assignment or test.  I provide sample solutions to all assignments and exams which I expect the students to read.  Furthermore, I provide practice exam questions which I encourage the students to work on in exam conditions.

I believe that truly learning a topic takes a long time.  For example, in my own practice I have discovered subtleties and errors in my understanding in subjects I have taught several times before.  So it is my opinion that a learners job is never done.  The student must read or listen to the material (in lectures or online).  Then they must apply the material but only in a superficial way. At this point, a student must review the material again and, if it doesn't make sense, they have many resources to help them - friends in the class, my office hours, my e-mail, the help desk offered by the department, and supplemental notes online. Once these concepts start to solidify they can explore the nooks and crannies, and they can see how the different concepts interact.  It is my responsibility to provide an environment in which a student can flourish, by motivating the subject and each concept, by providing a range of exercises to engage the student, by providing supplemental notes for additional investigation and by making myself available through e-mail and office hours.  It is the students responsibility to take advantage of these tools and to take an interest in the course.

The classes that I look upon with fondness are those classes where all course materials really blended together.  The lectures were enthusiastic and clearly presented and any examples presented gave insight to the concepts.  Furthermore, the lectures informed the questions on the assignments, and vice verse. I work towards this ideal in the hopes that I can pass on my knowledge and enjoyment of math.

### Professional development
- CUTL
- graduate student thingy from April 2019

### Student learning
- provides at least three examples and evidence of practitioner designed learning activities or support which lead to student growth

### Courses I have taught

- **Math 3272 - Abstract Algebra II** - this is a core course for the B.Sc. Mathematics students to complete. Topics include $$ p $$-groups, group actions, polynomial rings, and field extensions.
- **Math 3274 - Set Theory** - This is a core course for the B.Sc. Mathematics degree. Topics include axioms of set theory, relations, natural numbers, real numbers, cardinality, axiom of choice, and point-set topology.
- **Math 6100 - Graduate Algebra** - This is a graduate algebra course. Topics include nilpotent groups, solvable groups, field extensions, algebraic closures, Galois theory.
- **Math 2400 - Elementary Number Theory** - an elective mathematics course. Topics include arithmetic mod $$ n $$, linear Diophantine equations, continued fractions.
- **Math 3273 - Linear Algebra II** - a core course for the B.Sc. Mathematics degree. Topics include canonical forms, singular value decomposition.
- **Mathematics for computing** (under several different course codes) - first year mathematics course for Computer Science/Information Technology students.
